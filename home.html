        <h2>What is Talk Back?</h2>
        <p>Talk Back is designed to help improve your conversational skills through guided practice and feedback. Talk Back helps you
            take time to consciously remove words from your speech you would rather avoid, and add words into your vocabulary that might
            increase your specificity and descriptiveness. Talk Back is an extra hand in gaining clarity and composure in your communication.

        <h2>Getting Started</h2>
        <p>First, you'll select the words you would like to avoid using when you talk, and well as any you'd like to start using.
            After that, you will record a short video of yourself talking, either about a subject of your choice, or one given by a 
            prompt. Once you're done, Talk Back will provide feedback about when and where you used certain words, and give you advice
            on how to improve.
